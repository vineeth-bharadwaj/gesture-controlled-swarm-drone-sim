The arduino code provided was the code for Arduino Nano 33 IoT that comes with on-board LSM6DS3 6-axis IMU sensor.
The code has to be adjusted if a different board and sensor is being used. But the logic of the code remains the same.
Currently the code is needs Serial communication. As seen in the wireless gesture recognition code, the Serial communication can be replaced with wireless communication as well. 
The model trained with data collected from Serial port can still work with the wireless communication as well. 
But wireless communication will always have more latency than Serial communication. Hence prediction accuracy reduces. 
So its better to train the model on data collected in the same way it is collected during real time application.
