# gesture-controlled-swarm-drone-sim
This is a proof of concept project on an application of IMU-based Gesture Recognition in swarm UAV control. This repository contains all the codes in Python for data collection, data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, real time gesture recognition, and a PyGame+OpenGL based simulation of a swarm of 3 drones controlled through IMU
